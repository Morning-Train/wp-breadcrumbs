### Change Seperator

You can change the seperator by calling `seperator` on the BreadcrumbGenerator.

```

### Hide on Front Page
You can easily hide the breadcrumbs on the frontpage by calling `hideOnFrontPage` on the BreadcrumbGenerator.

```

### Remove Prefixed Front Page
You can remove the prefixed front page breadcrumb on all pages by calling `hidePrefixedFrontPagePart` on the BreadcrumbGenerator.

```php
\Morningtrain\WP\Breadcrumbs\Breadcrumbs::compose()->hidePrefixedFrontPagePart()->render();
```
